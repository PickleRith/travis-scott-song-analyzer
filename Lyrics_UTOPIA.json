And I recline and I sit still\nMight as well turn up now, He gon' pop up unannounced\nTo the trumpets, do you like the way it sounds? (Like the way it sound)\n\nYou know the future of the bounce, ayy\nI can hear your thoughts so loud, I can hear the crowd so loud\nDo you like the way it sounds?

Can't let you\nNiggas plottin' my demise, I got murder on my mind\nI got money on the line, I can't lose if I tried\nLet no bitch break my stride\nChosen, I'm gon' bet on me\nChosen, all my shit antique\nFrozen, I can't feel no heat\nDiamonds dancing on me\nYou startin' fresh, man, you fell out of pocket\nYou fucked that girl that you met at the party\nI got some new niggas down in the lobby\nHow can I sleep when you're out catchin' bodies?\nI still wanna be with you, trust me, I know that's insane\nI'd rather fuck on you than fuck on lames\nI did some shit in Berlin, I'm OD\nWe both ain't shit and it's workin' for me\nWorkin' for me, yeah\nI can see the future, I can see the future22Embed"
