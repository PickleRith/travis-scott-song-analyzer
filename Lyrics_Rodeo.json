Who do I owe? Nigga, no one\nThey pickin' you up, but you low down, animated actin' frozen\nI got porno pics, wish I can post them, stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em\nNiggas askin' for the old him, but I'm way too young to be the old him\nI'ma make this shit crack Lamar Odom 'til I climb to the top of the podium\n\nSo wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga\nNiggas in the bushes, niggas on the farm, might gotta rake up a nigga\nI'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic\nI might move out to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish\n\nWe gon' rule the world, we gon' rule the world\nWe gon' rule the world, hmm\n(Never gonna stop, never gonna stop, never ever gonna stop it)\nLa Flame says, \"Let your ambition carry you\"112Embed"

One shot, two shots and you still talkin' crazy (Trippy)\nThree shots and you faded, freaks comin' out at night and they gettin' X-rated\nFour shots now, she wanna do the clique, any more shots, she ain't gon' remember shit\nSmokin' on extendos, no clips, project hoes goin' up in the Ritz (Trippy)\nShe gon' do it for a G, anything for me, bruh, she just wanna fuck and drink and chief all the weed up\nSexy bitch, pop that pussy 'cause you in your prime, pour that purple over ice, call it \"turtle time\"\nShawty never been a hesitator, got her goin' down on the elevator\nHeard the pussy bomb, I'ma detonate her, fuck her from the back, keep the neck for later\nNo magic trick, but I levitate her, with the magic stick, nothin' less than great\nWhen I hit her with the dope D, I'm gone, don't text me later, no extra favors\nIt's really goin' down in the goddamn South\nI'm trill, I'm country 'til the end\nIt-it-it-it's really goin' down in the goddamn South\nI'm trill, I'm country 'til the end\n\nHmm, weed, lean, MDMA, he say, she say\nAll the products of a young man gone the long way\nFrom the home that he known, 'til he roamed where he at\nAnd the phone break up, unknown wake up\nSeveral one-night-stands, hung up phone, break up\nIf he fall, will he fly? Sure, it wouldn't take much\nFor you to find out, jump, have you took that plunge?\nIf not in the same spot, how could you judge?\n(H-h-how could you judge? C-c-could you judge?)52Embed"
